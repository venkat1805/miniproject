               <p>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the 2nd book of a current 8 part series of Harry Potter.
                   It was written by J.K. Rowling in 1998. The book covers the 2nd year of Harry Potter at the 
                   Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizadry. It shows all the adventures Harry has along with his
                   friends, Ron and Hermione. The book also covers certain secrets which the first book had kept a mystery
                   of in the readers' minds. I am quite satisfied to realize some things which I had dearly wanted to 
                   know after I finished the first book.

               <p>
                   If you are unfamiliar with Harry Potter and his magical world, here is some quick summary. Harry Potter
                   was a boy of 11 years, living a miserable life with his uncle, when he came to know he owned magical
                   abilities and was invited to the prestigious institute of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizadry.
                   It is here that he makes his 2 dewarest friends, Ron and Hermione. The book shows the trio's 
                   adventures as the story progresses.

               <h2>What I liked about the book:</h2>
               <br>
               <ol>
                   <li>It covered many secrets which were present in the 1st book that creates a sense of 
                       exhilaration in them.
                   </li>
                   <li>The story gets very adventurous as it progresses.</li>
                   <li>The story is capable in creating that intense thrill in readers at the end and even after the climax.</li>
                   <li>The story is intriguing throughout and does not bore the reader.</li>
               </ol>
               <br>
               <h2>What I didn't like about the book:</h2>
               <br>
               <ol>
                   <li>As it is a series, intoduction is critical. I felt the introduction could have been better
                       for the book.
                   </li>
               </ol>
               <!-- Conclusion -->
               <p id="conclusion">
                   There is nothing I can honestly hate about the book, to be honest. I specially appreciate J.K. Rowling
                   on creating that same excitement on the minds and the same emotions in the hearts of readers after 
                   reading the book. Harry Potter is a series where every character WILL have a picture, voice, moralty
                   and behaviour in a person's mind without any external help.
                   <br>
                   Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets has more events and matching levels of suspense and
                   excitement than the 1st one. I recommend reading the book if you are familiar with the 
                   Harry Potter franchise and haven't read it yet.
