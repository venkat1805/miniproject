            The Fault in Our Stars is a 2012 novel by John Green which features the love story of two cancer survivors, 
            Haze Grace and Augustus Waters. The book shows the difficult situations through which they face through and
            the relations they eventually develop between them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Fault in Our Stars was a book I had been wanting to read for many years. So, obviously the excitement of 
            reading it crept into me. But as I finish the book, I feel that excitement has quadrupled inside of me.
        </p>
        <p>
            The book begins with showing the day-to-day life of Hazel Grace, a sixteen year old cancer survivor, and also
            happens to be the narrator of this book. Hazel's life really shows the difficulty of a fighting patient, with
            oxygen tanks and cannulas all over her body. She goes to a Support Group for cancer survivors, where we meet
            characters like Isaac, an eye cancer patient, and Patrick, the leader of the group. It is here we meet Augustus
            Waters, a seventeen year old amputee.
        </p>
        <p>Augustus's character is developed throughout the story and he plays a big role here in transforming Hazel from
            desolate to hopeful and cheerful. Their relationship forms a key part of the book.
        </p>
        <p>A big sub-plot is about the writer, Peter van Houten, whose book, An Imperial Affiction was admired by Hazel 
            and Augustus. In between the book, the mysterious writer turns real and modifies everyones' expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a huge philosophical aspect to the story too, with many philosophical thoughts mentioned. These parts
            encourages readers to think. I personally find them quite fascinating.
        </p>

        <h2>What I liked about the book:</h2>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>The philosophical thoughts are just wonderful! Really like them!</li>
            <li>The story has made me cry, laugh, think or fall angry at different sections; and thinking a book can achieve
                that is a great thing. In some parts, I was laughing out loud; and in some parts, I felt very sad.</li>
            <li>I felt amazed at how a perception of a person could change so much. Of course, I mean Peter van Houten,
                and though I am not going to tell you about it if you have not read the book, let me tell you you will be amazed
                at how your perceptions change.(spoiler alert, I first felt he was a wise person, later, angry and felt he was a douchebag, then felt sympathy for him).
            </li>
            <li>The difficulties of a cancer patient, or any patient for the matter, is well shown. I felt that strain of
                of carrying around many tubes in the case of Hazel.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h2>What I don't like about the book:</h2>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>I felt the Augustus and Caroline Matthews story was left incomplete.</li>
            <li>What Hazel calls Augustus Waters exactly is not clear; usually a person is preferred to be called a single
                name, specially when in a close relationship. However, Hazel calls Augustus sometimes and Gus other times. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <p id="conclusion">
            The very end of the book honestly made me very sad, which was unanticipated by me after I was treated with high
            doses of laughter at the beginning. If you haven't read the book, I definitely recommend you read it. A fun book
            and a memorable read.
