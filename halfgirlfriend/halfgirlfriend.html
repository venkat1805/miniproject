              <p> 'Half Girlfriend' is a book written by Chetan Bhagat. The book covers the love story of Madhav 
                  & Riya,2 people from totally different backgrounds. Madhav is a regional man whereas Riya is from
                  a rich Marwari family.Though they are totally different from each other, there's somthing which
                  links them together.
              </p>
             <p>
                 Madhav wants a relationship with Riya, however, Riya wanted them to be friends. They finally came 
                 to a conclusion. Riya could be Madhav's half-girlfriend.
             </p>

          <h2>What I like about the story:</h2>
          <br>
          <ol>
              <li>Emotions of character like Madhav and Riya explain their personalities and the author has conveyed
                  it well.
              </li>
              <li>Life in the real India, especially in the rural areas is explained. Power shortages, peoples'
                  mindsets, child labour is all described.
              </li>
              <li>The US landscape has been done better than any other setting in the story. A sense of direction
                  in evolved and the easiness of the system is explained. The author has particularly described
                  every detail perfectly and I think it is a plus point.
              </li>
              <li>Certain families' systems in India are well explained. The rich people drink a lot, talk 
                  business most of the time. The wives wear rich clothes but they are only allowed Indian dresses.
                  The wife and the husband's mother has a fight. It is not meant in general but is a thing which
                  could be happening in India.
              </li>
              <li>The story has so much moral value in it, if thought in depth. It teaches us not to fall under 
                  money, business and work. Money and lush life may not bring happiness. It also makes a point
                  women could wear their style of clothing and that it should not be controlled.
              </li>
              <li>The author shows a distinction of language and approach of Madhav and Riya from their college 
                  life and their future. A maturity seems to see into both of them. Madhav controls his offensive language
                  and makes a decent approach to Riya, comparing to his aggressive and quickening one at college.
                  His mindset changes too, as he cares more about Riya and is not desperate in conveying his love
                  for her. Riya keeps it calm too compared to her college life.
              </li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <h2>What I don't like about the story:</h2>
          <br>
          <ol>
              <li>Madhav's and Riya's college life is not much discussed except their personal matters.
                  No exams or preaparations or such things as ragging were mentioned. Though this is a love
                  story, it would have been nice to include these.
              </li>
              <li>Madhav's school was initially described well. However, later, fast forward to the end of 
                  story, you realize after the grant programme, there hasn't been much description of the changes
                  except the fact that that was one of the best schools. Even then, the category in which Dumraon
                  Royal School was popular at is not clearly specified. Any change in staff or students is also
                  not specified.
              </li>
              <li>I think Madhav showed less concern in Riya at college. He said he loved her, still didn't 
                  care much about her matters then.
              </li>
              <li>Madhav's internship could have been more described, e.g. what his job progress was at 
                  intermediate stage, the data he had to work with, colleagues, work pattern, etc.
              </li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <!-- Conclusion -->
          <p id="conclusion">
              Eventually the story is fun to read and it resembles one of Chetan's many topics. The story takes
              place in 3 different places, and all 3 if them has its own interesting story to tell. I liked 
              that all of them had Riya Somani in it, because, after all eventually it's a love story. I also
              liked Chetan's description of NYC. The lifestyle and design of the city comes to be felt in your
              mind. Anyway, good book. And like Chetan's other books, I wouldn't recommend it for a person 
              under 12.
